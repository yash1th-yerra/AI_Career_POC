    "\n",
    "3. **SUMMARY**: Look for sections titled \"Summary\", \"Objective\", \"Profile\", \"About Me\", \"Career Summary\". Extract complete professional summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SKILLS**: Extract skills ONLY from dedicated \"Skills\", \"Technical Skills\", \"Core Skills\", \"Programming Languages\", or similar sections:\n",
    "   - ONLY include skills explicitly listed in a dedicated skills section\n",
    "   - Programming languages, frameworks, tools, technologies mentioned in skills section\n",
    "   - Return as array of individual skills from the skills section only\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **EXTRA_SKILLS**: Extract additional skills mentioned in other contexts:\n",
    "   - Skills mentioned in work experience descriptions\n",
    "   - Technologies used in projects\n",
    "   - Skills mentioned in certifications or education\n",
    "   - Any other skills not in the main skills section\n",
    "   - Return as array of individual skills from non-skills sections\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **WORK_EXPERIENCE**: Extract each position with:\n",
    "   - Job title, company, duration, location\n",
    "   - Key responsibilities and achievements\n",
    "   - Format as structured objects with consistent fields\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **PROJECTS**: Extract personal/academic projects with:\n",
    "   - Project name, duration, technologies used\n",
    "   - Brief description and key features\n",
    "   - Any notable achievements or results\n",
    "\n",

    "10. **ATS_FEEDBACK**: Provide objective evaluation:\n",
