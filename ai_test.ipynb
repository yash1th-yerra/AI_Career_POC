    "\n",
    "3. **SUMMARY**: Look for sections titled \"Summary\", \"Objective\", \"Profile\", \"About Me\", \"Career Summary\". Extract complete professional summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SKILLS**: Extract skills ONLY from dedicated \"Skills\", \"Technical Skills\", \"Core Skills\", \"Programming Languages\", or similar sections:\n",
    "   - ONLY include skills explicitly listed in a dedicated skills section\n",
    "   - Programming languages, frameworks, tools, technologies mentioned in skills section\n",

    "\n",
    "10. **EXPERIENCE_LEVEL**: Analyze the candidate's work experience and determine their experience level:\n",
    "    - \"Entry Level\" (0-1 years): Fresh graduates, internships, or minimal professional experience\n",
    "    - \"Junior\" (1-3 years): Some professional experience, early career roles\n",

    "    - \"Lead/Principal\" (12+ years): Expert level, can architect solutions and lead teams\n",
    "    - Consider total years of experience, complexity of roles, leadership responsibilities\n",
    "    - Return a single string value\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **RECOMMENDED_ROLES**: Based on the candidate's skills, experience, education, and projects, recommend 2-3 specific job roles they would be suitable for:\n",

    "  * \"extra_skills\" array: Skills mentioned in work experience, projects, certifications, education, or other contexts\n",
    "- Extract job/project details separately.\n",
    "- For EXPERIENCE_LEVEL: Analyze total years of professional experience, role complexity, and leadership indicators\n",
    "- For RECOMMENDED_ROLES: Analyze the candidate's profile holistically and suggest roles that align with their skills and experience level\n",
    "- Be consistent and produce clean JSON only.\n",
    "- Prioritize accuracy over completeness.\n",
