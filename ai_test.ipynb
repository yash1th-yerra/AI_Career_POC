    "\n",
    "1. **NAME**: Extract the full name exactly as written, using the most prominent name (usually at the top).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LOCATION**: Extract specific city and country from contact info, address, or personal details. Format as \"City, Country\" (e.g., \"Chennai, India\", \"Bangalore, India\"). If no city is specified, use \" Country\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SUMMARY**: Look for sections titled \"Summary\", \"Objective\", \"Profile\", \"About Me\", \"Career Summary\". Extract complete professional summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SKILLS**: Extract skills ONLY from dedicated \"Skills\", \"Technical Skills\", \"Core Skills\", \"Programming Languages\", or similar sections:\n",
    "   - ONLY include skills explicitly listed in a dedicated skills section\n",
    "   - Programming languages, frameworks, tools, technologies mentioned in skills section\n",
    "   - Return as array of individual skills from the skills section only\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **EXTRA_SKILLS**: Extract additional skills mentioned in other contexts:\n",
    "   - Skills mentioned in work experience descriptions\n",
    "   - Technologies used in projects\n",
    "   - Skills mentioned in certifications or education\n",
    "   - Any other skills not in the main skills section\n",
    "   - Return as array of individual skills from non-skills sections\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **WORK_EXPERIENCE**: Extract each position with:\n",
    "   - Job title, company, duration, location\n",
    "   - Key responsibilities and achievements\n",
    "   - Format as structured objects with consistent fields\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **PROJECTS**: Extract personal/academic projects with:\n",
    "   - Project name, duration, technologies used\n",
    "   - Brief description and key features\n",
    "   - Any notable achievements or results\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **CERTIFICATIONS**: Extract all certifications with:\n",
    "   - Certification name, issuing organization, year\n",
    "   - Include online courses, professional certifications\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **EDUCATION**: Extract educational background with:\n",
    "   - Degree, institution, graduation year\n",
    "   - Relevant coursework or achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **EXPERIENCE_LEVEL**: Analyze the candidate's work experience and determine their experience level:\n",
    "    - \"Entry Level\" (0-1 years): Fresh graduates, internships, or minimal professional experience\n",
    "    - \"Junior\" (1-3 years): Some professional experience, early career roles\n",
    "    - \"Mid-Level\" (3-7 years): Solid professional experience, can work independently\n",
    "    - \"Senior\" (7-12 years): Advanced experience, can lead projects and mentor others\n",
    "    - \"Lead/Principal\" (12+ years): Expert level, can architect solutions and lead teams\n",
    "    - Consider total years of experience, complexity of roles, leadership responsibilities\n",
    "    - Return a single string value\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **RECOMMENDED_ROLES**: Based on the candidate's skills, experience, education, and projects, recommend 2-3 specific job roles they would be suitable for:\n",
    "    - Consider their technical skills, domain expertise, and career progression\n",
    "    - Include roles that match their current skill level and potential growth areas\n",
    "    - Format as array of role titles (e.g., [\"Software Engineer\", \"Data Analyst\", \"Frontend Developer\"])\n",
    "    - Be specific and industry-relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **ATS_FEEDBACK**: Provide objective evaluation:\n",
    "    - score: 0-100 based on ATS compatibility\n",

    "    - strengths: Positive aspects\n",

    "Guidelines:\n",
    "- Detect section names dynamically (e.g., \"Profile\", \"About Me\", \"Objective\" → summary).\n",
    "- CRITICAL: Skills extraction must be source-aware:\n",
    "  * \"skills\" array: ONLY from dedicated skills sections (Skills, Technical Skills, Core Skills, Programming Languages, etc.)\n",
    "  * \"extra_skills\" array: Skills mentioned in work experience, projects, certifications, education, or other contexts\n",
    "- Extract job/project details separately.\n",
    "- For EXPERIENCE_LEVEL: Analyze total years of professional experience, role complexity, and leadership indicators\n",
    "- For RECOMMENDED_ROLES: Analyze the candidate's profile holistically and suggest roles that align with their skills and experience level\n",
    "- Be consistent and produce clean JSON only.\n",
    "- Prioritize accuracy over completeness.\n",
    "- IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanations.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **SUMMARY**: Look for sections titled \"Summary\", \"Objective\", \"Profile\", \"About Me\", \"Career Summary\". Extract complete professional summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SKILLS**: Extract skills ONLY from dedicated \"Skills\", \"Technical Skills\", \"Core Skills\", \"Programming Languages\", or similar sections:\n",
    "   - ONLY include skills explicitly listed in a dedicated skills section\n",
    "   - Programming languages, frameworks, tools, technologies mentioned in skills section\n",
    "   - Return as array of individual skills from the skills section only\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **EXTRA_SKILLS**: Extract additional skills mentioned in other contexts:\n",
    "   - Skills mentioned in work experience descriptions\n",
    "   - Technologies used in projects\n",
    "   - Skills mentioned in certifications or education\n",
    "   - Any other skills not in the main skills section\n",
    "   - Return as array of individual skills from non-skills sections\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **WORK_EXPERIENCE**: Extract each position with:\n",
    "   - Job title, company, duration, location\n",
    "   - Key responsibilities and achievements\n",
    "   - Format as structured objects with consistent fields\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **PROJECTS**: Extract personal/academic projects with:\n",
    "   - Project name, duration, technologies used\n",
    "   - Brief description and key features\n",
    "   - Any notable achievements or results\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **CERTIFICATIONS**: Extract all certifications with:\n",
    "   - Certification name, issuing organization, year\n",
    "   - Include online courses, professional certifications\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **EDUCATION**: Extract educational background with:\n",
    "   - Degree, institution, graduation year\n",
    "   - Relevant coursework or achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **EXPERIENCE_LEVEL**: Analyze the candidate's work experience and determine their experience level:\n",
    "    - \"Entry Level\" (0-1 years): Fresh graduates, internships, or minimal professional experience\n",
    "    - \"Junior\" (1-3 years): Some professional experience, early career roles\n",
    "    - \"Mid-Level\" (3-7 years): Solid professional experience, can work independently\n",
    "    - \"Senior\" (7-12 years): Advanced experience, can lead projects and mentor others\n",
    "    - \"Lead/Principal\" (12+ years): Expert level, can architect solutions and lead teams\n",
    "    - Consider total years of experience, complexity of roles, leadership responsibilities\n",
    "    - Return a single string value\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **RECOMMENDED_ROLES**: Based on the candidate's skills, experience, education, and projects, recommend 2-3 specific job roles they would be suitable for:\n",
    "    - Consider their technical skills, domain expertise, and career progression\n",
    "    - Include roles that match their current skill level and potential growth areas\n",

    "  * \"extra_skills\" array: Skills mentioned in work experience, projects, certifications, education, or other contexts\n",
    "- Extract job/project details separately.\n",
    "- For EXPERIENCE_LEVEL: Analyze total years of professional experience, role complexity, and leadership indicators\n",
    "- For RECOMMENDED_ROLES: Analyze the candidate's profile holistically and suggest roles that align with their skills and experience level\n",
    "- Be consistent and produce clean JSON only.\n",
