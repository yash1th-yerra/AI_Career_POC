    "\n",
    "3. **SUMMARY**: Look for sections titled \"Summary\", \"Objective\", \"Profile\", \"About Me\", \"Career Summary\". Extract complete professional summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SKILLS**: Extract skills ONLY from dedicated \"Skills\", \"Technical Skills\", \"Core Skills\", \"Programming Languages\", or similar sections:\n",
    "   - ONLY include skills explicitly listed in a dedicated skills section\n",
    "   - Programming languages, frameworks, tools, technologies mentioned in skills section\n",
    "   - Return as array of individual skills from the skills section only\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **EXTRA_SKILLS**: Extract additional skills mentioned in other contexts:\n",
    "   - Skills mentioned in work experience descriptions\n",
    "   - Technologies used in projects\n",
    "   - Skills mentioned in certifications or education\n",
    "   - Any other skills not in the main skills section\n",
    "   - Return as array of individual skills from non-skills sections\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **WORK_EXPERIENCE**: Extract each position with:\n",
    "   - Job title, company, duration, location\n",
    "   - Key responsibilities and achievements\n",
    "   - Format as structured objects with consistent fields\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **PROJECTS**: Extract personal/academic projects with:\n",
    "   - Project name, duration, technologies used\n",
    "   - Brief description and key features\n",
    "   - Any notable achievements or results\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **CERTIFICATIONS**: Extract all certifications with:\n",
    "   - Certification name, issuing organization, year\n",
    "   - Include online courses, professional certifications\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **EDUCATION**: Extract educational background with:\n",
    "   - Degree, institution, graduation year\n",
    "   - Relevant coursework or achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **EXPERIENCE_LEVEL**: Analyze the candidate's work experience and determine their experience level:\n",
    "    - \"Entry Level\" (0-1 years): Fresh graduates, internships, or minimal professional experience\n",
    "    - \"Junior\" (1-3 years): Some professional experience, early career roles\n",
    "    - \"Mid-Level\" (3-7 years): Solid professional experience, can work independently\n",
    "    - \"Senior\" (7-12 years): Advanced experience, can lead projects and mentor others\n",
    "    - \"Lead/Principal\" (12+ years): Expert level, can architect solutions and lead teams\n",
    "    - Consider total years of experience, complexity of roles, leadership responsibilities\n",
    "    - Return a single string value\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **RECOMMENDED_ROLES**: Based on the candidate's skills, experience, education, and projects, recommend 2-3 specific job roles they would be suitable for:\n",
    "    - Consider their technical skills, domain expertise, and career progression\n",
    "    - Include roles that match their current skill level and potential growth areas\n",
    "    - Format as array of role titles (e.g., [\"Software Engineer\", \"Data Analyst\", \"Frontend Developer\"])\n",
    "    - Be specific and industry-relevant\n",

    "    - strengths: Positive aspects\n",

    "- Detect section names dynamically (e.g., \"Profile\", \"About Me\", \"Objective\" → summary).\n",

    "  * \"extra_skills\" array: Skills mentioned in work experience, projects, certifications, education, or other contexts\n",
    "- Extract job/project details separately.\n",
    "- For EXPERIENCE_LEVEL: Analyze total years of professional experience, role complexity, and leadership indicators\n",
    "- For RECOMMENDED_ROLES: Analyze the candidate's profile holistically and suggest roles that align with their skills and experience level\n",
    "- Be consistent and produce clean JSON only.\n",
    "- Prioritize accuracy over completeness.\n",
    "- IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanations.\n",
